/* Fixme: It was not possible to convince Windows to use the manifest.
 * Thus we resort to static linking of gpgex with the helper
 * libraries.  The idea was to put have this directory layout
 *
 *   bin/gpgex.dll
 *   bin/GNU.GnuPG.Gcc64Support/GNU.GnuPG.Gcc64Support.manifest
 *   bin/GNU.GnuPG.Gcc64Support/libstdc++-6.dll
 *   bin/GNU.GnuPG.Gcc64Support/libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
 *
 * to cope with the 64 bit and 32 bit versions of the gcc support
 * libraries.  It works with exe files but not with DLLs loaded.  Any
 * hints to fix this are welcome.
