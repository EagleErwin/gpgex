GPG Explorer Extensions
=======================

This package contains GpgEX, the GNU Privacy Guard extensions for the
Windows Explorer shell.

Debugging
=========

A debug file path can be specified with the registry value "GpgEX
Debug File" in the HKLM\Software\GNU\GnuPG key.  To this file logging
information is appended.  Also see:

BUGS
====

* DllRegisterServer does not correctly figure out the DLL path name
  (it catches regsvr32.exe instead).  Thus the DLL path is hard coded
  to "C:\\gpgex.dll" for now.  You can change it in the registry by
  locating
  "HKCR\CLSID\{CCD955E4-5C16-4A33-AFDA-A8947A94946B}\InprocServer32"
  and changing the default value of that key.

* DllMain is not invoked for some reason, so i18n is not initialized
  and debugging output is done inefficiently.
